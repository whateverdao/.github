# Whatever DAO

WhateverDAO is a pseudo-company and experimental playground for developers, designers, and builders who learn by doing.
Think of it as an incubator for joke projects, half-baked ideas, and "what if?" experiments that may or may not see the
light of day.

We're here to ship weird stuff, break things, and occasionally stumble upon something that actually works.

## What we do:

- Build projects nobody asked for (but maybe should have)
- Test technologies we barely understand
- Create learning experiences through controlled chaos
- Embrace the philosophy of "ship first, regret later"

## Our governance model:

¯\\_(ツ)_/¯

## Our mission:

Whatever feels right at the time.

No roadmaps. No whitepapers. No promises. Just pure, unfiltered experimentation.
